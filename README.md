# Matplotlib and pyplot

I completed the the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository. Whew!!

The changes were committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).
I was having so much trouble with git push, that I forgot to export each step of the homework as an html file too, so I just did that at the end and uploaded it.
